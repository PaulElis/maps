      "description": " \r\n\u003cb\u003eAZMMCC is a Tucson Medical Marijuana Clinic\u003c/b\u003e\r\n   \r\nThe Arizona Medical Marijuana Certification Center, or AZMMCC, has made it their mission to provide the necessary certification for qualified patients to obtain medical cannabis within the parameters of the Arizona medical marijuana laws. Their marijuana doctors are sensitive to the apprehension Tucson patients may have surrounding medical cannabis, and are available to educate and inform their patients on all they need to know. Their goal is to provide compassionate care during the certification process, outfitting their Tucson patients with the knowledge to effectively utilize medical marijuana as an alternative form of therapeutic treatment. \r\n   \r\n\u003cb\u003eProcess:\u003c/b\u003e\r\nAZMMCC’s medical marijuana doctors are happy to walk their Tucson patients through Arizona’s stringent medical cannabis certification process. Their marijuana clinic adheres to the responsibilities required by Arizona medical marijuana laws while also taking steps to make the certification process as easy as possible. For a Tucson patient to qualify, they must have one of the ailments considered a qualifying condition to use cannabis in the state of Arizona. Patients should also collect their medical records from the previous three years before visiting AZMMCC. AZMMCC allows patients the option to have the clinic handle their medical records for them by completing a medical release form and mailing or faxing it to AZMMCC’s medical marijuana clinic. Once received, the cannabis doctor will review the patient's medical records to see if they qualify for the Arizona Medical Marijuana Program. If the patient qualifies for the program, one of AZMMCC’s staff members will reach out to schedule an appointment with a marijuana doctor. At the certification appointment, the marijuana doctor will discuss the patient's qualification for the Medical Marijuana Program and sign a Physician Certification Form. The marijuana patient must have a valid Arizona ID as well as physician fee present to receive their Physician Certification Form. \r\n   \r\n\u003cb\u003eLocal Legislation:\u003c/b\u003e\r\nThe Arizona Medical Marijuana Act was a voter-enacted initiative, and the task of regulating the act was given the state’s Department of Health. The Arizona Department of Health Services outlines the rules and statutes regarding medical marijuana in the state. The Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) and the Arizona Medical Marijuana Rules state the applicable requirements for the Arizona Medical Marijuana Program and are suggested by the Department of Health to be read in conjunction with each other. \r\n   \r\n\u003cb\u003eService Location:\u003c/b\u003e\r\nAZMMCC proudly offers their medical marijuana services to patients from all over Tucson including Starr Pass, the Armory Park Historic Residential District, and Rita Ranch. Those in Civano, Midvale Park, or Barrio Viejo are welcomed to get their marijuana certification from a cannabis doctor at AZMMCC. Arizona patients in Dunbar Spring, Blenman-Elm, or Barrio Hollywood can connect with an AZMMCC cannabis doctor as well. Those in Barrio Anita, Rincon Heights, or Old Fort Lowell are invited to AZMMCC for a medical cannabis evaluation. Barrio Centro, Northwest, and El Conquistador patients interested in getting a medical marijuana certification can make an appointment at AZMMCC for their evaluation. \r\n   \r\n\u003cb\u003eLocation Information:\u003c/b\u003e\r\nTucson is a city surrounded by several mountain ranges and resides in the Sonoran Desert. El Presidio Historic District shows off Tucson’s 19th-century origins through the neighborhoods immaculately restored mansions. Barrio Historico lends itself to Tucson’s past as well with its adobe row houses. Tucson has multiple entertainment options from nightlife with clubs and bars to vintage shops and restaurants. The city is also home to the University of Arizona. \r\n  ",
